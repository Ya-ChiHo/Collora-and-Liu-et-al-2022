# Collora-and-Liu-et-al-2021
Scripts related to the Collora and Liu et al 2021 manuscript.

Scripts are organzied by their purpose and the figure they relate to. Dates reflect the dates the particular iteration of analysis started on. Scripts without dates are amalgamations of various scripts for simplicity when an analysis was otherwise split across many places.  

Preprocessing - filtering, dimensionality reduction, integration, metadata annotation, etc., generating intermediates, etc. 

Figures contain subfolders with scripts that contain analysis as well as the figure outputs for things that appear in the manuscript. 

These scripts are minimally commented to be functional and reproducible, they are not tutorials. Questions, start an issue or email Jack.Collora@yale.edu or Ya-Chi.Ho@yale.edu

Some scripts refer to "Jack" or "Runxia" datasets which is due to this project originally being split between the first two authors, the unstimulated data (Jack) and the stimulated data (Runxia). Some scripts retain this nomenclature, and were not altered to avoid potentially breaking scripts or overlapping with existing stimulated/unstimulated naming.
