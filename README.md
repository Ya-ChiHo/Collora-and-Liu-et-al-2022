# Collora-and-Liu-et-al-2022
Scripts related to the Collora and Liu et al 2022 manuscript.

Scripts are organzied by their purpose and the figure they relate to. Dates reflect the dates the particular iteration of analysis started on. Scripts without dates are amalgamations of various scripts for simplicity when an analysis was otherwise split across many places.  

Preprocessing - filtering, dimensionality reduction, integration, metadata annotation, etc., generating intermediates, etc. 

Figures contain subfolders with scripts that contain analysis as well as the figure outputs for things that appear in the manuscript. 

These scripts are minimally commented to be functional and reproducible, they are not tutorials. Questions, start an issue or email Jack.Collora@yale.edu or Ya-Chi.Ho@yale.edu

Some scripts refer to "Jack" or "Runxia" datasets which is due to this project originally being split between the first two authors, the unstimulated data (Jack) and the stimulated data (Runxia). Some scripts retain this nomenclature, and were not altered to avoid potentially breaking scripts or overlapping with existing stimulated/unstimulated naming. 

Finally, there was a large number of scripts that did not yield interesting analyses which were not included here or in the manuscript. There may be (small) portions of the supplments not entierly representated in this repository (particularly related to supplmental figures). If there are particular aspects of the analysis you would like to see that are not otherwise here, please email Jack.Collora@yale.edu or Ya-Chi.Ho@yale.edu.
